## Step 1: Download a game ROM

Navigate to a website like [EmulatorGames.net](https://emulatorgames.net) and find a game.

## Step 2: Check the game's device

Check what device the game was made for. It should say that here:

If the game isn't supported by EmulatorWeb or EmulatorJS, don't bother using it. Here's a list of supported devices:
