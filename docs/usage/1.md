[< Back to Usage](README.md)

## Step 1: Download a game ROM

Navigate to a website like [EmulatorGames.net](https://emulatorgames.net) and find a game.

## Step 2: Check the game's device

Check what device the game was made for. It should say that here:

If the game isn't supported by EmulatorWeb or EmulatorJS, don't bother using it. Here's a list of supported devices:

## Step 5: Add the ROM

Drag the ROM to `public/[device name]/[game id]`
*e.g. `public/gba/1`*
Set the name of the ROM file to `[device name][game id].[file extension]`
*e.g. `gba1.gba` if the device was gba and the id was 1*.
